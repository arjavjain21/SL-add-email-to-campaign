# Smartlead Email Campaign Manager

A Streamlit web application that allows you to add email accounts from CSV files to your Smartlead campaigns efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-step workflow** with clear progress tracking
- **Campaign selection** with search and filtering capabilities
- **Bulk email account processing** (handles 16k+ accounts efficiently)
- **CSV upload** with validation and error handling
- **Preview and analysis** before making changes
- **Batch processing** with progress tracking
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Smartlead account with API access
- CSV file with email addresses

## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: Clone and Run Locally

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd smartlead-campaign-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/)
3. Click "New app" and connect your repository
4. Configure environment variables in Streamlit Cloud settings
5. Deploy!

### Option 3: Using the Setup Script

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in Streamlit Cloud or create a `.env` file locally:

```bash
SMARTLEAD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
APP_PASSWORD=strong_password_for_app_access
BATCH_SIZE=50
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=200
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Security note:** The app requires `APP_PASSWORD` to be defined in `st.secrets` (or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for Streamlit Cloud). If the secret is missing or the entered password is incorrect, the application will stop and display a clear error so deployments fail fast rather than running unprotected.

### Getting Your Smartlead API Key

1. Log in to your Smartlead account
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key and add it to your environment variables

## 📖 Usage

### Step 1: Enter API Key
- Enter your Smartlead API key in the sidebar
- The app will validate the key and fetch your campaigns

### Step 2: Select Campaign
- Browse and search through your available campaigns
- Filter by status (Active, Paused, etc.)
- View campaign details before selection
- Click "Next Step" to continue

### Step 3: Fetch Email Accounts
- Click the mandatory "Fetch All Email Accounts" button
- Wait for all your email accounts to be retrieved (may take time for large accounts)
- View account statistics and types

### Step 4: Upload CSV
- Upload a CSV file containing email addresses
- The CSV must have an 'email' column
- Other columns are ignored
- View sample emails found in the file

### Step 5: Map and Preview
- Click "Map Emails to Accounts" to find matching accounts
- Review the analysis:
  - Emails that will be added to the campaign
  - Emails already in the campaign
  - Emails not found in your account

### Step 6: Execute Changes
- Review the final summary
- Click "Execute Changes" to add accounts
- Monitor batch processing progress
- View results and error messages

## 📁 CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain emails in a column named 'email' (case-insensitive):

```csv
email,name,company,role
john@example.com,John Doe,Acme Corp,Engineer
jane@test.com,Jane Smith,Tech Inc,Manager
```

**Valid email column names:** `email`, `Email`, `EMAIL`, `email_address`, `emailaddress`

## 🚨 Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid API keys
- Network connectivity issues
- Malformed CSV files
- Invalid email addresses
- API rate limiting
- Missing email accounts

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch campaigns"**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your Smartlead account is active

**"No email column found in CSV"**
- Ensure your CSV has an 'email' column
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Make sure the file is saved as CSV format

**"Email account not found"**
- Verify the email exists in your Smartlead account
- Check for typos in the email addresses
- Ensure the email accounts are properly configured in Smartlead

**Processing is slow**
- Large account lists (16k+) take time to fetch
- Batch processing helps but may still take time
- Monitor progress bars for real-time updates

## 📊 Performance

The application is optimized for:
- **Memory efficiency**: Processes large datasets without memory issues
- **API rate limiting**: Respects Smartlead API limits with exponential backoff
- **Batch processing**: Adds accounts in batches of 50 by default
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback during long operations
